# w3bsmerge
- A simple merge of W3.css and Bootstrap. Also includes a few templates if you're having any trouble.
- Remember to add the HTML code in the head section that makes the file actually use the JS and CSS, because without those it would just be a normal HTML file, with no W3.CSS or Bootstrap.
